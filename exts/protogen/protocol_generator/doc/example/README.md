# Protogen example #

This is an toy project that uses Protogen generated code.
It includes both the server and the device code.

Note: the device code (as a Morpheus 3.X project) includes the compiled jar generated by Protogen (but not necessarily by the current Protogen version). Just add this jar to your classpath if you want to test the code.

The server code will be generated automagically by Ragent or by the server SDK if you import the agent project.
